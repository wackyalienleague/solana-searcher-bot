# Solana Searcher Bot – Jito gRPC Integration

This project is an early-stage Solana searcher bot designed to interact with the Jito Block Engine via gRPC.

## 🔍 Strategies

- Token launch sniping (Pump.fun, LetsBonk)
- Bundle simulation + fast tip injection
- Tip-based block priority access
- Optional latency-based arbitrage and copy trading

## 💡 Features

- Uses `SimulateBundle` and `SendBundle` gRPC methods
- Custom buy logic based on token metadata and early volume
- Dynamic tip calculation to optimize inclusion rate

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python or Rust (WIP)
- Solana Web3 + Jito gRPC
- Private backend infra

## 🚧 Status

This is a placeholder repo to outline intent while the full strategy is tested and developed privately.

## 🤝 Contact

Open to validator collabs and Jito-related research.
